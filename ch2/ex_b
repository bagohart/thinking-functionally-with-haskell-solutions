[0,1] <- no :)
double -3 <- subtraction, double interpreted as variable, but is function. should produce strange error message.
double (-3) <- Int
double double 0 <- function application (double double) is evaluated first, should fail
if 1==0 then 2==1 <- else branch is missing
"++" == "+" ++ "+" <- Bool
[(+), (-)] <- Num a => [a -> a -> a] (a list of binary functions on numbers)
[...] <- [[[[a]]]]
concat ["tea","for",'2'] <- broken types, Char != [Char]
