map double [1,4,4,3] -> [2,8,8,6]
map (double . double) [1,4,4,3] -> [4,16,16,12]
map double [] -> []

sum . map double = double . sum
^ true: a*b + a*c = a * (b + c) aka distributive law

sum . map sum = sum . concat
^ (a + b) + (c + d) = (a + b + c + d) aka associative law

sum . sort = sum
^ (a + b) = (b + a) aka commutative law
